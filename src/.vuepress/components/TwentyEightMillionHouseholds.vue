        <v-card-title>How many households are there?</v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            <p>There are around <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/families/bulletins/familiesandhouseholds/2022#:~:text=Households-,There%20were%20an%20estimated%2028.2%20million%20households%20in%20the%20UK,2012%20(26.6%20million%20households).">28M</a> households in the UK</p>
            <p>There has to be the equivalent of 3.2M households with nothing to account for those 200 billionaires.</p>
            <p>That's more than 10% of the net worth of the UK population.</p>
            <p>The average household size is <a href="https://www.globaldata.com/data-insights/macroeconomic/average-household-size-in-the-united-kingdom-2096133/#:~:text=the%20United%20Kingdom-,The%20United%20Kingdom%20had%20an%20average%20household%20size%20of%202.4,2010%2C%20between%202010%20and%202021.">2.4 people</a>.</p>
            <p>I have rounded that to 2.5 again to make the maths simpler.</p>
