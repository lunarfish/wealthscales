        <v-card-title>What does it all mean?</v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
            <p>The cost-of-living crisis, children living in poverty, working families who can't afford 
            food or fuel: These are not consequences of the Russia/Ukraine war, or COVID or immigration.</p>
            <p>We are both individually and societally impoverished by a few people's pursuit of wealth.</p>
            <p>Were the wealth equally distributed, each household would have that average net worth of 
            close to half a million pounds.</p>
            <p>The situation we are in is a consequence of the insatiable pursuit of wealth by the rich.</p>
            <p>But to get back to a reasonable standard of life for everyone one we don't need to 
            embrace communism.</p>
            <p>We just need to curb the worst excesses of capitalism.</p>
            <p>No-one needs to be a billionaire.</p>
            <p>There is no-one who can legitimately claim to be worth 
            5,000 people (2.5 people times 2000 households).</p>
            <p>Let alone 175,000 people (Â£35B).</p>
